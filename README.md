# Knowledge Graph Radar

The Knowledge Graph Radar is an attempt to keep track of interesting people, projects, applications and so forth *related to* the [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph) space.

> When I say "*related to*" I am going broad rather than narrow. That is, I will porbably be including a lot of stuff that is only quite loosely related to knowledge graphs per se but that **could be** of interest within the context of the development of [Contextualise](https://contextualise.dev), a (collaborative) knowledge management application that I am developing. Having said that, I will try to stay on topic as much as possible :)
